## Conclusions

Based on our results, for studies focused on the functional consequences of cancer mutations, we recommend that researchers cancers prioritize downstream readouts based on the gene or genes of interest (Figure {@fig:heatmap}).
On balance, prediction of mutation status is best in general using gene expression data, and prediction of patient survival is similar for all data types in the study.
However, the finding that for many genes, multiple functional profiles contain much of the same information will be useful for some study designs, given varying cost and stability of different readouts.
In addition to gene expression, results using DNA methylation and RPPA measurements as predictive features were promising, especially considering the substantially lower dimensionality of the RPPA dataset compared to other data types.
It is important to note that the specific technologies chosen by TCGA, and the tradeoffs inherent in such a high-throughput study, could influence the comparison: it is possible that, for instance, another technology for measuring DNA methylation (such as bisulfite sequencing) or another technique for measuring protein abundance (such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics) could change performance for those data types.
Future technology advances, in both quality and quantity of data, are likely to improve our understanding of the full picture of functional consequences of mutations in cancer cells.
