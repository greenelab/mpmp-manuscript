### Using diverse data modalities to predict cancer alterations

We collected five different data modalities from cancer samples in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, capturing five steps of cellular function that are perturbed by genetic alterations in cancer (Figure {@fig:overview}A).
These included gene expression (RNA-seq data), DNA methylation (27K and 450K Illumina BeadChip arrays), protein abundance (RPPA data), microRNA expression data, and patterns of somatic mutation (mutational signatures).
To link these diverse data modalities to changes in mutation status, we used elastic net logistic regression to predict the presence or absence of mutations in cancer genes, using these readouts as predictive features (Figure {@fig:overview}B).
We evaluated the resulting mutation status classifiers in a pan-cancer setting, preserving the proportions of each of the 33 cancer types in TCGA for 8 train/test splits (4 folds x 2 replicates) in each of 85 cancer genes (Figure {@fig:overview}C).

We sought to compare classifiers against a baseline where mutation labels are permuted (to identify genes whose mutation status correlates strongly with a functional signature in a given data type), and also to compare classifiers trained on true labels across different data types (to identify data types that are more or less predictive of mutations in a given gene).
To account for variation between dataset splits in making these comparisons, we treat classification metrics from the 8 train/test splits as performance distributions, which we compare using _t_-tests.
We summarize performance across all genes in our cancer gene set using a similar approach to a volcano plot, in which each point is a gene.
In our summary plots, the x-axis shows the magnitude of the change in the classification metric between conditions, and the y-axis shows the _p_-value for the associated _t_-test.
Figure {@fig:overview}C illustrates this evaluation pipeline.

Arrows represent major potential paths of information flow from a somatic mutation in DNA to its resulting cell phenotype; circular arrow represents the ability of certain mutations (e.g. in DNA damage repair genes) to alter somatic mutation patterns.
Note that this does not reflect all possible relationships between cellular processes: for instance, changes in gene expression can lead to changes in somatic mutation rates.
**B.** Predicting presence/absence of somatic alterations in cancer from diverse data modalities.
In this study, we use functional readouts from TCGA as predictive features and the presence or absence of mutation in a given gene as labels.
This reverses the primary direction of information flow shown in Panel A.

### Selection of cancer-related genes improves predictive signal

As a baseline, we evaluated prediction of mutation status from gene expression data across several different gene sets.
Past work has evaluated mutation prediction for the top 50 most mutated genes in TCGA [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3], and we sought to extend this to a broader list of gene sets.
We compared a set of cancer-related genes from Vogelstein et al. 2013 [@doi:10.1126/science.1235122] with a set of random genes having equal size, and a set of the most mutated genes in TCGA having equal size.
For all gene sets, we used only the set of TCGA samples for which both gene expression and somatic mutation data exists, resulting in a total of 9,074 samples from all 33 cancer types (Figure {@fig:expression_gene_sets}A).
This set of samples was further filtered for each target gene to cancer types containing at least 15 mutated samples and at least 5% of samples mutated for that cancer type.
We then evaluated the performance for each target gene in each of the three gene sets.

Figure {@fig:expression_gene_sets}B summarizes performance for all genes in each gene set.
Genes from the Vogelstein et al. set were more predictable than randomly chosen genes or those selected by total mutation count.
Figures {@fig:expression_gene_sets}C, {@fig:expression_gene_sets}D, and {@fig:expression_gene_sets}E show performance for each gene in the random gene set, most mutated gene set, and Vogelstein et al. gene set respectively.
<!-- TODO: I'll fix these numbers once the missing genes stuff gets figured out/finishes running (gene counts for all three datasets will be the same then) -->
<!-- https://github.com/greenelab/mpmp/issues/44 -->
In total, for a significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.001$, 60/98 genes (61.2%) in the Vogelstein et al. gene set are significantly predictable from gene expression data, compared to 10/107 genes (9.35%) in the random gene set and 43/107 genes (40.2%) in the most mutated gene set.
Additionally, Figure {@fig:expression_gene_sets}D shows that many of the significant genes in the most mutated gene set are clustered close to the significance threshold, while the significant genes in the Vogelstein et al. gene set tend to be further from the threshold in Figure {@fig:expression_gene_sets}E (i.e. higher AUPR differences and lower _p_-values).
These results suggest that selecting target genes for mutation prediction based on prior knowledge of their involvement in cancer pathways and processes, rather than randomly or based on mutation frequency alone, can improve predictive signal and identify more highly predictable mutations from gene expression data.

### Comparing six different readouts favors expression and DNA methylation

Next, we expanded our comparison to all five functional data modalities (six total readouts, since there are two DNA methylation datasets) available in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas.
As with previous experiments, we limited our comparison to the set of samples profiled for each readout, resulting in 5,226 samples with data for all readouts.
The data types with the most missing samples were RPPA data (2,215 samples that were missing RPPA data) and 450K methylation (630 samples that were missing 450K methylation data) (Figure {@fig:all_data}A).
Summarized over all genes in the Vogelstein et al. dataset, we observed that gene expression and both methylation datasets tended to produce similar quality predictions, and these tended to be slightly better than the remaining data types (Figure {@fig:all_data}B).
For the set of genes having at least one significant predictor (i.e. "well-predicted" genes), median performance using gene expression was slightly higher than for the methylation data types, although this difference was not statistically significant (Figure {@fig:all_data}C).

On the individual gene level, mutations in 25/75 genes were significantly predictable from RPPA data relative to the permuted baseline, compared to 24/75 genes from microRNA data and 3/75 genes from mutational signatures data (Figure {@fig:all_data}D-F).
For the remaining data types on this smaller set of samples, 34/75 genes outperformed the baseline for gene expression data, 32/75 for 27k methylation, and 30/75 for 450k methylation.
Compared to the methylation experiments shown in Figure {@fig:methylation}, we observed slightly fewer "well-predicted" genes for the expression and methylation datasets here (likely due to the considerably smaller sample size) but relative performance was comparable.
Direct comparisons between each added data type and gene expression data showed that RPPA data produces comparable or improved predictions for a small number of genes (Figure {@fig:all_data}G), but microRNA and mutational signatures data generally provide similar or worse performance (Figure {@fig:all_data}H-I).
Performance using RPPA data is notable because of its drastically smaller dimensionality than the other data types (190 proteins, compared to thousands of features for the expression and methylation data types), suggesting that each protein abundance measurement provides a high information content.
Mutations that are more predictable using RPPA data include _PIK3R1_ and _MAP2K1_ (Figure {@fig:all_data}G).
Both genes are kinases involved in phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction.
The ability of RPPA technology to quantify protein phosphorylation status may thus provide an advantage in identifying mutations in these genes, relative to the other data types we used that cannot directly measure protein phosphorylation.

When we constructed a heatmap depicting predictive performance for each gene across data types, we found that very few genes tended to be well-predicted exclusively by one or two data types (Figure {@fig:heatmap}).
Of the 39 genes that are well-predicted using at least one data type (blue or red highlighted boxes in Figure {@fig:heatmap}), only three of them are well-predicted exclusively by a single data type, meaning that mutations in the other 37 genes can be predicted effectively using at least two different data sources.
This supports our observation that choosing the "correct" data modality is often unimportant for driver genes with strong functional signatures.
Notable exceptions included _NF1_ (only well-predicted using gene expression data), _SETD2_ (only well-predicted using the two methylation datasets), and _TSC1_ (only well-predicted using gene expression data).
Gene expression provided the best performance in 25/39 genes with at least one significant data type (red highlighted boxes in Figure {@fig:heatmap}), but only 2 of those 25 genes did not have any other significantly predictive data types (_NF1_ and _TSC1_); in the other 23 genes one or more non-expression data types also outperformed the permuted baseline.
