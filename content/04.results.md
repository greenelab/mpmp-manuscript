### Using diverse data modalities to predict cancer alterations

We collected four different readouts from cancer samples in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, capturing four steps of cellular function that are perturbed by genetic alterations in cancer (Figure {@fig:overview}A).
These included gene expression (RNA-seq data), DNA methylation (27K and 450K Illumina BeadChip arrays), protein abundance (RPPA data), and patterns of somatic mutation (mutational signatures).
To link these diverse data modalities to changes in mutation status, we used elastic net logistic regression to predict the presence or absence of mutations in cancer genes, using these readouts as predictive features (Figure {@fig:overview}B).
We evaluated the resulting mutation status classifiers in a pan-cancer setting, preserving the proportions of each of the 33 cancer types in TCGA for 8 train/test splits (4 folds x 2 replicates) in each of 107 cancer genes (Figure {@fig:overview}C).

In our analyses, we sought to compare classifiers against a naive baseline (to identify genes whose mutation status correlates strongly with a gene signature in a given data type) and against one another (to identify data types that are more or less predictive of mutations in a given gene).
To account for variation between dataset splits in making these comparisons, we treat classification metrics from the 8 train/test splits as performance distributions, which we compare using _t_-tests.
For each comparison, we summarized performance across all genes in our cancer gene set using a volcano-like plot, in which each point is a gene.
The x-axis shows the magnitude of the change in the classification metric between conditions, and the y-axis shows the _p_-value for the associated _t_-test.
Figure {@fig:overview}C illustrates this evaluation pipeline.

**A.** Cancer mutations can perturb cellular function via a variety of cellular processes.
Arrows represent major potential paths of information flow from a somatic mutation in DNA to its resulting cell phenotype; circular arrow represents the ability of certain mutations (e.g. in DNA damage repair genes) to alter somatic mutation patterns.
Note that this does not reflect all possible relationships between cellular processes: for instance, changes in gene expression can lead to changes in somatic mutation rates.
**B.** Predicting presence/absence of somatic alterations in cancer from diverse data modalities.
In this study, we use functional readouts from TCGA as predictive features and the presence or absence of mutation in a given gene as labels, the reverse of the information flow in Panel A.
