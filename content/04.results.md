### Using diverse data modalities to predict cancer alterations

We collected four different readouts from cancer samples in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas, capturing four steps of cellular function that are perturbed by genetic alterations in cancer (Figure {@fig:overview}A).
These included gene expression (RNA-seq data), DNA methylation (27K and 450K Illumina BeadChip arrays), protein abundance (RPPA data), and patterns of somatic mutation (mutational signatures).
To link these diverse data modalities to changes in mutation status, we used elastic net logistic regression to predict the presence or absence of mutations in cancer genes, using these readouts as predictive features (Figure {@fig:overview}B).
We evaluated the resulting mutation status classifiers in a pan-cancer setting, preserving the proportions of each of the 33 cancer types in TCGA for 8 train/test splits (4 folds x 2 replicates) in each of 107 cancer genes (Figure {@fig:overview}C).

We sought to compare classifiers against a baseline where mutation labels are shuffled (to identify genes whose mutation status correlates strongly with a functional signature in a given data type), and also to compare classifiers trained on true labels across different data types (to identify data types that are more or less predictive of mutations in a given gene).
To account for variation between dataset splits in making these comparisons, we treat classification metrics from the 8 train/test splits as performance distributions, which we compare using _t_-tests.
We summarize performance across all genes in our cancer gene set using a similar approach to a volcano plot, in which each point is a gene.
In our summary plots, the x-axis shows the magnitude of the change in the classification metric between conditions, and the y-axis shows the _p_-value for the associated _t_-test.
Figure {@fig:overview}C illustrates this evaluation pipeline.

Arrows represent major potential paths of information flow from a somatic mutation in DNA to its resulting cell phenotype; circular arrow represents the ability of certain mutations (e.g. in DNA damage repair genes) to alter somatic mutation patterns.
Note that this does not reflect all possible relationships between cellular processes: for instance, changes in gene expression can lead to changes in somatic mutation rates.
**B.** Predicting presence/absence of somatic alterations in cancer from diverse data modalities.
In this study, we use functional readouts from TCGA as predictive features and the presence or absence of mutation in a given gene as labels.
This reverses the primary direction of information flow shown in Panel A.

### Predicting mutation status from gene expression and DNA methylation

We performed several analyses to compare gene expression with DNA methylation as downstream readouts of the effects of cancer alterations.
In these analyses, we considered both the 27K probe and 450K probe methylation datasets generated for the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas.
Based on the results of the gene set experiments, here we considered only the set of cancer-related genes derived from Vogelstein et al.
Like the experiments that used only gene expression data, we used TCGA samples that had data for each of the data types being compared, including somatic mutation data to generate mutation labels.
Figure {@fig:methylation}A displays the overlap between the expression and methylation datasets used, resulting in 7,981 samples for which all data types were profiled.
The most frequent missing data types were somatic mutation data (1,114 samples) and 450K methylation data (1,072 samples).

Overall performance across data types is summarized in Figure {@fig:methylation}B.
Gene expression data with raw (uncompressed) features tends to outperform other data types, as well as outperforming prediction from gene expression data compressed using principal component analysis (PCA).
Figure {@fig:methylation}C summarizes results for the set of genes that are significantly predictable from at least one data type, compared to a baseline classifier with shuffled labels.
After filtering for genes that exceed the significance threshold, the performance improvement using gene expression is clearer than using all genes.
In other words, genes with significant predictive signal above our baseline tend to be substantially more predictable from raw gene expression features than from raw or PCA-compressed features derived from either of the methylation datasets.

<!-- TODO: fix weird gene counts here too -->
Considering each target gene in the Vogelstein gene set individually, we observed that 52/90 genes significantly outperformed the shuffled baseline using gene expression data, as compared to 39/90 genes for 27K methylation and 37/90 genes for 450K methylation (Figure {@fig:methylation}D-F).
In addition to comparing mutation classifiers trained on different data types to a baseline with a shuffled label, we also compared classifiers trained on true mutation labels directly to each other, using a similar methodology (Figure {@fig:methylation}G-H).
We observed that 19/100 genes were significantly more predictable from expression data than 27K methylation data, and 10/100 genes were significantly more predictable from expression data than 450K methylation data.
In both cases, 0/100 genes were significantly more predictable using the methylation data types.
Taken together, our data suggest that across the Vogelstein et al. gene set, gene expression data tends to capture more signal distinguishing between presence and absence of cancer-related mutations than DNA methylation data.
