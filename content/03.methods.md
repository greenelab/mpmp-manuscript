## Methods

### Mutation data download and preprocessing

To generate binary mutated/non-mutated gene labels for our machine learning model, we used mutation calls for TCGA samples from MC3 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.002] and copy number threshold calls from GISTIC2.0 [@doi:10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41].
MC3 mutation calls were downloaded from the Genome Data Commons (GDC) of the National Cancer Institute, at [`https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas`](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas).
Copy number threshold calls are from an older version of PanCanAtlas, and are available here: [`https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TCGA_PanCanAtlas_Copy_Number_Data/6144122`](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TCGA_PanCanAtlas_Copy_Number_Data/6144122).
We removed hypermutated samples (defined as five or more standard deviations above the mean non-silent somatic mutation count) from our dataset to reduce the number of false positives (i.e., non-driver mutations).
In total, this resulted in 9,074 TCGA samples with mutation and copy number data.
Any sample with a non-silent somatic variant in the target gene was included in the positive set.
We also included copy number gains in the target gene for oncogenes, and copy number losses in the target gene for tumor suppressor genes, in the positive set; all remaining samples were considered negative for mutation in the target gene.

### Omics data download and preprocessing

RNA sequencing, 27K and 450K methylation array, and RPPA datasets for TCGA samples were all downloaded from GDC, at the same link provided above.
Mutational signatures information for TCGA samples with whole-exome sequencing data was downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal, at [`https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/mutational_signatures/Signatures_in_Samples/SP_Signatures_in_Samples`](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/mutational_signatures/Signatures_in_Samples/SP_Signatures_in_Samples).
For our experiments, we used only the "single base signature" (SBS) mutational signatures, generated in [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3].
We standardized (took z-scores of) each column of RNA sequencing and RPPA data; methylation data and mutational signatures data were left untransformed (beta values and mutation counts respectively), except in multi-omics experiments where all data types were standardized.
For the RNA sequencing dataset, we used only the top 8,000 gene features by mean absolute deviation as predictors in our models, except in multi-omics experiments where all 15,639 genes were used.

In order to remove missing values from the methylation datasets, we removed the 10 samples with the most missing values, then performed mean imputation for probes with 1 or 2 values missing.
All probes with missing values remaining after sample filtering and imputation were dropped from the analysis.
This left us with 20,040 CpG probes in the 27K methylation dataset, and 370,961 CpG probes in the 450K methylation dataset.
For experiments where "raw" methylation data was used, we used the top 100,000 probes in the 450K dataset by mean absolute deviation for computational efficiency, and we used all of the 20,040 probes in the 27K dataset.
For experiments where "compressed" methylation data was used, we used principal component analysis (PCA), as implemented in the `scikit-learn` Python library [@url:https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v12/pedregosa11a.html], to extract the top 5,000 principal components from the methylation datasets.
We initially applied the beta-mixture quantile normalization (BMIQ) method [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts680] to correct for variability in signal intensity between type I and type II probes, but we observed that this had no effect on our results.
We report uncorrected results in the main paper for simplicity.

To make a fair comparison in each of the experiments displayed in the results, we used the intersection of TCGA samples having measurements for all of the datasets being compared in that experiment.
This resulted in 3 distinct sets of samples: 9,074 samples shared between expression and mutation data, 7,981 samples shared between expression/mutation/27K methylation/450K methylation, and 5,282 samples shared between expression/mutation/27K methylation/450K methylation/RPPA/mutational signatures.
When we dropped samples between experiments as progressively more data types were added, we observed that the dropped samples had approximately the same cancer type proportions as the dataset as a whole.
In other words, samples that were profiled for one data type but not another did not tend to come exclusively from one or a few cancer types.
Exceptions included acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) which had no samples profiled in the RPPA data, and ovarian cancer (OV) which had only 8 samples with 450K methylation data.
More detailed information on cancer type proportions profiled for each data type is provided in (the supplement).
