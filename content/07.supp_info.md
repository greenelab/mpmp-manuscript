A version of the main paper figures using the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) metric rather than AUPR is available at [`https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14919729`](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14919729).

Proportion of samples from each TCGA cancer type that are "dropped" as more data types are added to our analyses. We started with gene expression data, and for each added data type, we took the intersection of samples that were profiled for that data type and the previous data types, dropping all samples that were missing 1 or more data types. Overall, at each step, the proportions of "dropped" samples appear to be fairly evenly spread between cancer types, showing that in general we are not disproportionately losing one or several cancer types as more data modalities are added to our analyses.

Table: Number of samples from each TCGA cancer type that are "dropped" as more data types are added to the analysis. The "base" column indicates the number of samples that are present per cancer type in the final intersection of all data types (i.e. each sample counted in the last column has data for each of the 7 data types, including gene expression (not listed here) and somatic mutations). {#tbl:cancer_type_proportions}

Heatmap displaying predictive performance for mutations in each of the 84 genes from the Vogelstein et al. gene set, across gene expression and the two DNA methylation arrays. Each cell quantifies performance for a target gene, using predictive features derived from a particular data type. Grey shaded dots indicate that the given data type provides significantly better predictions than the permuted baseline for the given gene; black inner dots indicate the same and additionally that the given data type provides statistically equivalent performance to the data type with the best average performance (determined by pairwise _t_-tests across data types with FDR correction).

Volcano-like plots showing predictive performance for each gene in the Vogelstein et al. gene set for expression and DNA methylation, on the sample set used for the "all data types" experiments. The first row shows performance relative to the permuted baseline, and the second row shows direct comparisons between data types. The _x_-axis shows the difference in mean AUPR compared with a baseline model trained on permuted labels, and the _y_-axis shows _p_-values for a paired _t_-test comparing cross-validated AUPR values within folds.

Predictive performance for genes in the Vogelstein et al. gene set, using each of the three data types as predictors.
The _x_-axis shows the number of PCA components used as features, "raw" = no PCA compression.

Survival prediction performance for top 10 PCA components, for individual cancer types.
The top row shows the five cancer types with the highest average coefficient of variation across data types, for expression, 27K methylation, and 450K methylation.
The bottom row shows the five cancer types with the highest average coefficient of variation across data types, for the comparison using all 6 data types.
Each box plot displays the c-index distribution across 8 performance measurements (2 cross-validation replicates x 4 folds).
The grey dotted line shows mean performance for a model using only non-omics covariates (patient age at diagnosis and log~10~(sample mutation count)); grey shaded area indicated bootstrapped 95% confidence interval.

Top plot: comparing the best-performing model (i.e. highest mean AUPR relative to permuted baseline) trained on a single data type against the best "multi-omics" model for each target gene, using raw (not PCA compressed) features. For feature parity between data types, the top 20,000 features by mean absolute deviation were used for each data type.
The difference between single-omics and multi-omics performance for _TP53_ was statistically significant (_p_=0.0078), but other differences between single-omics and multi-omics models were not statistically significant using paired-sample Wilcoxon tests across cross-validation folds, for a threshold of 0.05.
Bottom plots: classifier performance, relative to baseline with permuted labels, for individual genes. Each panel shows performance for one of the six target genes; box plots show performance distribution over 8 evaluation sets (4 cross-validation folds x 2 replicates).
