![
Proportion of samples from each TCGA cancer type that are "dropped" as more data types are added to the analysis. We started with gene expression data, and for each added data type, we took the intersection of samples that were profiled for that data type and the previous data types, dropping all samples that were missing 1 or more data types. Overall, at each step, the proportions of "dropped" samples appear to be fairly evenly spread between cancer types, showing that in general we are not disproportionately losing one or several cancer types as data types are added.

Table: Number of samples from each TCGA cancer type that are "dropped" as more data types are added to the analysis. The "base" column indicates the number of samples that are present per cancer type in the final intersection of all data types (i.e. each sample counted in the last column has data for each of the 7 data types, including gene expression (not listed here) and somatic mutations). {#tbl:cancer_type_proportions}
