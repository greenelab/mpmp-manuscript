## Abstract {.page_break_before}




## Introduction

Although cancer can be initiated and driven by many different genetic alterations, these tend to converge on a limited number of pathways or signaling processes [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.035].
A comprehensive understanding of how diverse genetic alterations perturb these central pathways is vital to precision medicine and biomarker identification efforts, as driver mutation status alone confers limited prognostic information [@doi:10.7554/eLife.39217; @doi:10.1038/ncomms12096].
While many methods exist to distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations based on genomic sequence characteristics [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1616440113; @doi:10.1038/s41467-019-11284-9; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006658], until recently it has been a challenge to connect driver mutations to downstream changes in gene expression and cellular function within individual tumor samples.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Atlas provides uniformly processed, multi-platform -omics measurements across tens of thousands of samples from 33 cancer types [@doi:10.1038/ng.2764].
Enabled by this publicly available data, a growing body of work on linking the presence of driving genetic alterations in cancer to downstream gene expression changes has emerged.
Recent studies have considered Ras pathway alteration status in colorectal cancer [@doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1943], alteration status across many cancer types in Ras genes [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.046; @doi:10.1093/bib/bbaa258], TP53 [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076], and PIK3CA [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0241514], and alteration status across cancer types in frequently mutated genes [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3].
More broadly, other groups have drawn on similar ideas to distinguish between the functional effects of different alterations in the same driver gene [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.02.128850], to link alterations with similar gene expression signatures within cancer types [@doi:10.1142/9789811215636_0031], and to identify trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci (trans-eQTLs) in germline genetic studies [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.07.083386].

These studies share a common thread: they each combine genomic (point mutation and copy number variation) data with transcriptomic (RNA sequencing) data within samples to interrogate the functional effects of genetic variation.
RNA sequencing is ubiquitous and cheap, and its experimental and computational methods are relatively mature, making it a vital tool for generating insight into cancer pathology [@doi:10.1038/nrg.2017.96].
Some driver mutations, however, are known to act indirectly on gene expression through varying mechanisms.
For example, oncogenic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in glioma have been shown to interfere with histone demethylation, which results in increased DNA methylation and blocked cell differentiation [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa0808710; @doi:10.1038/nature10860].
Other genes implicated in aberrant DNA methylation in cancer include the TET family of genes [@doi:10.1016/j.tig.2014.07.005] and SETD2 [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a026468].
Certain driver mutations, such as those in DNA damage repair genes, may lead to detectable patterns of somatic mutation [@doi:10.1038/nrg3729].
Additionally, correlation between gene expression and protein abundance in cancer cell lines is limited, and proteomics data could correspond more directly to certain cancer phenotypes and pathway perturbations [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.12.023].
In these contexts and others, integrating different data modalities or combining multiple data modalities could be more effective than relying solely on gene expression as a functional signature.

Here, we seek to compare -omics data types profiled in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas for use as a multivariate functional readout of genetic alterations in cancer.
We focus on DNA methylation (27K and 450K probe chips), reverse phase protein array (RPPA), and mutational signatures data [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3] as alternative readouts.
Prior studies have identified univariate correlations of CpG site methylation [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005840; @doi:10.1186/s12920-018-0425-z] and correlations of RPPA protein profiles [@doi:10.1186/s13073-018-0591-9] with the presence or absence of certain driver mutations.
Other relevant past work includes linking point mutations and copy number variants (CNVs) with changes in methylation and expression at individual genes [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr019; @doi:10.1093/bib/bbw037] and identifying functional modules that are perturbed by somatic mutations [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq182; @doi:10.1038/ncomms9554].
However, no direct comparison has been made between different data types for this application, particularly in the multivariate case where we consider changes to -omics-derived gene signatures rather than individual genes in isolation.

We select a wide-ranging collection of potential cancer drivers with varying functions and roles in cancer development [@doi:10.1126/science.1235122].
We use mutation status in these genes as labels to train classifiers, using each of the data types listed as training data, in a pan-cancer setting; we follow similar methods to the elastic net logistic regression approach described in Way et al. 2018 [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.046] and Way et al. 2020 [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3].
We show that although there is considerable predictive signal for many genes in each dataset relative to a random baseline, gene expression data tends to provide more effective predictions than the other data types in the vast majority of cases.
In addition, we observe that combining data types into a single multi-omics model provides little, if any, performance benefit over the most performant model using a single data type.
Our results will help to inform the design of future functional genomics studies in cancer, suggesting that RNA sequencing can serve as a broadly effective first-line readout for a variety of genetic alterations.



## Methods

### Mutation data download and preprocessing

To generate binary mutated/non-mutated gene labels for our machine learning model, we used mutation calls for TCGA samples from MC3 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.002] and copy number threshold calls from GISTIC2.0 [@doi:10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41].
MC3 mutation calls were downloaded from the Genome Data Commons (GDC) of the National Cancer Institute, at [`https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas`](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/pancanatlas).
Copy number threshold calls are from an older version of PanCanAtlas, and are available here: [`https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TCGA_PanCanAtlas_Copy_Number_Data/6144122`](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TCGA_PanCanAtlas_Copy_Number_Data/6144122).
We removed hypermutated samples (defined as five or more standard deviations above the mean non-silent somatic mutation count) from our dataset to reduce the number of false positives (i.e., non-driver mutations).
In total, this resulted in 9,074 TCGA samples with mutation and copy number data.
Any sample with a non-silent somatic variant in the target gene was included in the positive set.
We also included copy number gains in the target gene for oncogenes, and copy number losses in the target gene for tumor suppressor genes, in the positive set; all remaining samples were considered negative for mutation in the target gene.

### Omics data download and preprocessing

RNA sequencing, 27K and 450K methylation array, and RPPA datasets for TCGA samples were all downloaded from GDC, at the same link provided above.
Mutational signatures information for TCGA samples with whole-exome sequencing data was downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal, at [`https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/mutational_signatures/Signatures_in_Samples/SP_Signatures_in_Samples`](https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/mutational_signatures/Signatures_in_Samples/SP_Signatures_in_Samples).
For our experiments, we used only the "single base signature" (SBS) mutational signatures, generated in [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-1943-3].
We standardized (took z-scores of) each column of RNA sequencing and RPPA data; methylation data and mutational signatures data were left untransformed (beta values and mutation counts respectively), except in multi-omics experiments where all data types were standardized.
For the RNA sequencing dataset, we used only the top 8,000 gene features by mean absolute deviation as predictors in our models, except in multi-omics experiments where all 15,639 genes were used.

In order to remove missing values from the methylation datasets, we removed the 10 samples with the most missing values, then performed mean imputation for probes with 1 or 2 values missing.
All probes with missing values remaining after sample filtering and imputation were dropped from the analysis.
This left us with 20,040 CpG probes in the 27K methylation dataset, and 370,961 CpG probes in the 450K methylation dataset.
For experiments where "raw" methylation data was used, we used the top 100,000 probes in the 450K dataset by mean absolute deviation for computational efficiency, and we used all of the 20,040 probes in the 27K dataset.
For experiments where "compressed" methylation data was used, we used principal component analysis (PCA), as implemented in the `scikit-learn` Python library [@url:https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v12/pedregosa11a.html], to extract the top 5,000 principal components from the methylation datasets.
We initially applied the beta-mixture quantile normalization (BMIQ) method [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts680] to correct for variability in signal intensity between type I and type II probes, but we observed that this had no effect on our results.
We report uncorrected results in the main paper for simplicity.

To make a fair comparison in each of the experiments displayed in the results, we used the intersection of TCGA samples having measurements for all of the datasets being compared in that experiment.
This resulted in 3 distinct sets of samples: 9,074 samples shared between expression and mutation data, 7,981 samples shared between expression/mutation/27K methylation/450K methylation, and 5,282 samples shared between expression/mutation/27K methylation/450K methylation/RPPA/mutational signatures.
When we dropped samples between experiments as progressively more data types were added, we observed that the dropped samples had approximately the same cancer type proportions as the dataset as a whole.
In other words, samples that were profiled for one data type but not another did not tend to come exclusively from one or a few cancer types.
Exceptions included acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) which had no samples profiled in the RPPA data, and ovarian cancer (OV) which had only 8 samples with 450K methylation data.
More detailed information on cancer type proportions profiled for each data type is provided in (the supplement).
